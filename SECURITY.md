# Security Policy

The code for this project is originally from Bitcoin Core. The application also requires connecting to a running Bitcoin Core node. Issues related to the original code, such as bugs in IPC, as best reported upstream: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/SECURITY.md

The Template Provider is still considered experimental and should not be exposed to the internet. Most security issues can therefore safely be reported by simply opening an Github issue on this repository.
