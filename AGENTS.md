# Guidance for Automated Agents

To keep the repository tidy and easy to maintain, automated agents should follow these principles:

- **Follow established style.** Consult the developer guidelines in [`doc/developer-notes.md`](doc/developer-notes.md) before writing or editing code. Adhere to the documented formatting, naming, and documentation conventions unless the project maintainers request otherwise.
- **Wrap commit messages.** Follow the 50/72 rule: keep the subject line at or
  below 50 characters, and wrap body lines to 72 characters.
- **Compose long commit messages.** Use the shell's `$'...'` quoting when
  invoking `git commit -m` so multi-line bodies keep their intended newlines.
- **Mind indentation-sensitive formats.** When touching YAML, Python, Markdown lists, or other whitespace-aware files, preserve the existing indentation levels, use spaces instead of tabs, and keep continuation alignment. Prefer editing tools like `apply_patch` that keep surrounding context intact, and re-read the affected block before saving to avoid shifting keys or breaking workflows.
- **Delete obsolete source files.** When retiring code, prefer removing the corresponding files outright instead of leaving stub implementations (for example, those containing only `#error` guards).
- **Confirm large refactors.** When a deletion task appears to require non-trivial refactoring elsewhere, pause and ask for confirmation firstâ€”consider whether removing the code you're about to refactor is a better alternative.
- **Update build metadata.** After deleting files, ensure any build scripts, project files, or documentation lists referencing them are updated accordingly.
- **Validate the build.** Always rebuild and run the relevant tests after removing files to confirm that no hidden dependencies remain.
- **Consult the linters.** Review the CI lint entry point at [`ci/lint/06_script.sh`](ci/lint/06_script.sh) to understand which linters the project runs. When feasible, execute the relevant linters locally or follow their documented rules before submitting changes. As the first line of defense, run the quick checks `test/lint/check-doc.py` (argument documentation) and `test/lint/lint-includes.py` (include hygiene) before proposing changes; both scripts execute in seconds and catch common regressions.

Following these steps keeps dead code from lingering and helps future contributors understand the current surface area of the project.
