Release Process
====================

Note: I'm only following small subset of this process at the moment and there
are still references to Bitcoin Core.

## Branch updates

### Before every release candidate

* Update release candidate version in `CMakeLists.txt` (`CLIENT_VERSION_RC`).
* Update manpages (after rebuilding the binaries), see [gen-manpages.py](/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagespy).

### Before every major and minor release

* Update version in `CMakeLists.txt` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_RC` to `0`).
* Update manpages (see previous section)
* Write release notes (see "Write the release notes" below) in doc/release-notes.md. If necessary,
  archive the previous release notes as doc/release-notes/release-notes-${VERSION}.md.

### Before every major release

* On both the master branch and the new release branch:
  - update `CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR` in [`CMakeLists.txt`](../CMakeLists.txt)
* On the new release branch in [`CMakeLists.txt`](../CMakeLists.txt)(see [this commit](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/742f7dd)):
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR` to `0`
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD` to `0`
  - set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`

#### Before branch-off

- Clear the release notes and move them to the wiki (see "Write the release notes" below).

#### After branch-off (on the major release branch)

- Update the versions.
- Create the draft, named "*version* Release Notes Draft", as a [collaborative wiki](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/_new).
- Clear the release notes: `cp doc/release-notes-empty-template.md doc/release-notes.md`
- Create a pinned meta-issue for testing the release candidate (see [this issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27621) for an example) and provide a link to it in the release announcements where useful.
- Prune inputs from the sv2-tp-qa-assets repo (See [pruning
  inputs](https://github.com/Sjors/sv2-tp-qa-assets#pruning-inputs)).

#### Before final release

- Ensure the "Needs release note" label is removed from all relevant pull
  requests and issues:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=label%3A%22Needs+release+note%22

#### Tagging a release (candidate)

To tag the version (or release candidate) in git, use the `make-tag.py` script from [bitcoin-maintainer-tools](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools). From the root of the repository run:

    ../bitcoin-maintainer-tools/make-tag.py v(new version, e.g. 25.0)

This will perform a few last-minute consistency checks in the build system files, and if they pass, create a signed tag.

## Building

### First time / New builders

Install Guix using one of the installation methods detailed in
[contrib/guix/INSTALL.md](/contrib/guix/INSTALL.md).

Check out the source code in the following directory hierarchy.

    cd /path/to/your/toplevel/build
    git clone https://github.com/sjors/sv2-tp-guix.sigs.git
    git clone https://github.com/sjors/sv2-tp-detached-sigs.git
    git clone https://github.com/sjors/sv2-tp.git

### Write the release notes

Open a draft of the release notes for collaborative editing at TBD.

For the period during which the notes are being edited on the wiki, the version on the branch should be wiped and replaced with a link to the wiki which should be used for all announcements until `-final`.

Generate list of authors:

    git log --format='- %aN' v(current version, e.g. 25.0)..v(new version, e.g. 25.1) | grep -v 'merge-script' | sort -fiu

### Setup and perform Guix builds

Checkout the Template Provider version you'd like to build:

```sh
pushd ./bitcoin
SIGNER='(your builder key, ie bluematt, sipa, etc)'
VERSION='(new version without v-prefix, e.g. 25.0)'
git fetch origin "v${VERSION}"
git checkout "v${VERSION}"
popd
```

Ensure your guix.sigs are up-to-date if you wish to `guix-verify` your builds
against other `guix-attest` signatures.

```sh
git -C ./guix.sigs pull
```

### Create the macOS SDK tarball (first time, or when SDK version changes)

Create the macOS SDK tarball, see the [macdeploy
instructions](/contrib/macdeploy/README.md#sdk-extraction) for
details.

### Build and attest to build outputs

Follow the relevant Guix README.md sections:
- [Building](/contrib/guix/README.md#building)
- [Attesting to build outputs](/contrib/guix/README.md#attesting-to-build-outputs)

### Verify other builders' signatures to your own (optional)

- [Verifying build output attestations](/contrib/guix/README.md#verifying-build-output-attestations)

### Commit your non codesigned signature to guix.sigs

```sh
pushd ./guix.sigs
git add "${VERSION}/${SIGNER}"/noncodesigned.SHA256SUMS{,.asc}
git commit -m "Add attestations by ${SIGNER} for ${VERSION} non-codesigned"
popd
```

Then open a Pull Request to the [guix.sigs repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs).

## Codesigning

### macOS codesigner only: Create detached macOS signatures (assuming [signapple](https://github.com/achow101/signapple/) is installed and up to date with master branch)

In the `guix-build-${VERSION}/output/x86_64-apple-darwin` and `guix-build-${VERSION}/output/arm64-apple-darwin` directories:

    tar xf bitcoin-${VERSION}-${ARCH}-apple-darwin-codesigning.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh /path/to/codesign.p12 /path/to/AuthKey_foo.p8 uuid
    Enter the keychain password and authorize the signature
    signature-osx.tar.gz will be created

### Windows codesigner only: Create detached Windows signatures

In the `guix-build-${VERSION}/output/x86_64-w64-mingw32` directory:

    tar xf bitcoin-${VERSION}-win64-codesigning.tar.gz
    ./detached-sig-create.sh /path/to/codesign.key
    Enter the passphrase for the key when prompted
    signature-win.tar.gz will be created

### Windows and macOS codesigners only: test code signatures
It is advised to test that the code signature attaches properly prior to tagging by performing the `guix-codesign` step.
However if this is done, once the release has been tagged in the bitcoin-detached-sigs repo, the `guix-codesign` step must be performed again in order for the guix attestation to be valid when compared against the attestations of non-codesigner builds. The directories created by `guix-codesign` will need to be cleared prior to running `guix-codesign` again.

### Windows and macOS codesigners only: Commit the detached codesign payloads

```sh
pushd ./bitcoin-detached-sigs
# checkout or create the appropriate branch for this release series
git checkout --orphan <branch>
# if you are the macOS codesigner
rm -rf osx
tar xf signature-osx.tar.gz
# if you are the windows codesigner
rm -rf win
tar xf signature-win.tar.gz
git add -A
git commit -m "<version>: {osx,win} signature for {rc,final}"
git tag -s "v${VERSION}" HEAD
git push the current branch and new tag
popd
```

### Non-codesigners: wait for Windows and macOS detached signatures

- Once the Windows and macOS builds each have 3 matching signatures, they will be signed with their respective release keys.
- Detached signatures will then be committed to the [bitcoin-detached-sigs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs) repository, which can be combined with the unsigned apps to create signed binaries.

### Create the codesigned build outputs

- [Codesigning build outputs](/contrib/guix/README.md#codesigning-build-outputs)

### Verify other builders' signatures to your own (optional)

- [Verifying build output attestations](/contrib/guix/README.md#verifying-build-output-attestations)

### Commit your codesigned signature to guix.sigs (for the signed macOS/Windows binaries)

```sh
pushd ./guix.sigs
git add "${VERSION}/${SIGNER}"/all.SHA256SUMS{,.asc}
git commit -m "Add attestations by ${SIGNER} for ${VERSION} codesigned"
popd
```

Then open a Pull Request to the [guix.sigs repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/guix.sigs).

## After 6 or more people have guix-built and their results match

After verifying signatures, combine the `all.SHA256SUMS.asc` file from all signers into `SHA256SUMS.asc`:

```bash
cat "$VERSION"/*/all.SHA256SUMS.asc > SHA256SUMS.asc
```


- Upload to Github release:
    1. The contents of each `./bitcoin/guix-build-${VERSION}/output/${HOST}/` directory.

       Guix will output all of the results into host subdirectories, but the SHA256SUMS
       file does not include these subdirectories. In order for downloads via torrent
       to verify without directory structure modification, all of the uploaded files
       need to be in the same directory as the SHA256SUMS file.

       Wait until all of these files have finished uploading before uploading the SHA256SUMS(.asc) files.

    2. The `SHA256SUMS` file

    3. The `SHA256SUMS.asc` combined signature file you just created.

- Archive the release notes for the new version to `doc/release-notes/release-notes-${VERSION}.md`
  (branch `master` and branch of the release).

- Update repositories

  - Delete post-EOL [release branches](https://github.com/sjors/sv2-tp/branches/all) and create a tag `v${branch_name}-final`.

  - Create a [new GitHub release](https://github.com/sjors/sv2-tp/releases/new) with a link to the archived release notes

- Announce the release:

  - SRI Discord

  - bitcoin-dev mailing list

  - Celebrate
